abstract = "Cloudcomputinghasrevolutionizedinformationtechnology,inthatItallowsenterprisesanduserstolower computing expenses by outsourcing their needs to a cloud service provider. However, despite all the benefits it brings, cloud computing raises several security concerns that have not yet been fully addressed to a satisfactory note. Indeed, by outsourcing its operations, a client surrenders control to the service provider and needs assurance that data is dealt with in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, the most inherent security issue of cloud computing is multi-tenancy. Cloud computing is a shared platform where usersâ€™ data are hosted in the same physical infrastructure. A malicious user can exploit this fact to steal the data of the users whom he or she is sharing the platform with. To address the aforementioned security issues, we propose a security risk quantification method that will allow users and cloud com- puting administrators to measure the security level of a given cloud ecosystem. Our risk quantification method is an adaptation of the fault tree analysis, which is a modeling tool that has proven to be highly effective in mission-critical systems. We replaced the faults by the probable vulnerabilities in a cloud system, and with the help of the common vulnerability scoring system, we were able to generate the risk formula. In addition to addressing the previously men- tioned issues, we were also able to quantify the security risks of a popular cloud management stack, and propose an architecture where users can evaluate and rank different cloud service providers."
